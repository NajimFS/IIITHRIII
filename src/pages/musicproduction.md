- ### 🎚️ Mastering Cuts
  
    Cut everything under 30Hz on the master.

    For intros, cut below 90Hz to let low pads breathe.

- ### 🧪 Sound Design
  
    Use reverb, FX, and layering to extract the most from samples.
  
    Prioritize layering, but aim to maximize each sound creatively.

- ### 🔗 Sidechain Tips
  
  Sidechain sub and mid bass to kick and snare.

- ### 📈 Loudness Target
  
    Use a limiter on the master to hit 3 to -5 LUFS.
